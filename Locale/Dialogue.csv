DG_ZONE1_LV1_1,"COMMANDER!!!"
DG_ZONE1_LV1_2,"Commander, look at the screen!"
DG_ZONE1_LV1_3,"[speed mult = 2.0]WHAT!?![/speed]"
DG_ZONE1_LV1_4,"[speed mult=1.4]We're being attacked by viruses![/speed]"
DG_ZONE1_LV1_5,"[speed mult=1.4]Everybody, in position, now!![/speed]"
DG_ZONE1_LV1_6,"This is a distress call. If anyone out there is listening..."
DG_ZONE1_LV1_7,"Our computer is being invaded by viruses!"
DG_ZONE1_LV1_8,"We need any help you can send!"
DG_ZONE1_LV2_1,"Look lively, people! We have viruses to kill!"
DG_ZONE1_LV2_2,"Just a simple, minor invasion to stop."
DG_ZONE1_LV2_3,"If anything goes wrong, I'll eat my hat."
DG_ZONE1_LV2_4,"Let's move out!"
DG_ZONE1_LV2_5,"Wait for me!"
DG_ZONE1_LV8_1,"Come on! Move, move!!"
DG_ZONE1_LV9_1,"Take this gun, you'll need it."
DG_ZONE1_LV9_2,"Ok, listen up everyone!"
DG_ZONE1_LV9_3,"We're gonna give this breach all we've got!"
DG_ZONE1_LV9_4,"On my mark!"
DG_ZONE1_LV9_5,"3... 2..."
DG_ZONE1_LV10_1,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_1,"oof"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_2,"...Where am I?"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_3,"Hey! Up here!"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_4,"Boy am I glad someone else survived that..."
DG_ZONE2_LV1_5,"We have to get back to base and warn them about what's coming!"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_6,"But I can't get this barrier open."
DG_ZONE2_LV1_7,"Can you see any viruses down there?"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_8,"Yeah, one. But, uh..."
DG_ZONE2_LV1_9,"Its got a shield on its head! I can't jump on it!"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_10,"A shield on its head? Hmmm..."
DG_ZONE2_LV1_11,"That's pretty [speed mult=0.2]advanced[/speed] if you get my meaning..."
DG_ZONE2_LV1_12,"[speed mult=1.5]I know[/speed]! Do you have a gun?"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_13,"Yes!"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_14,"Then try using that! Press the SPACE BAR to fire it."
DG_ZONE2_LV1_15,"That did it!"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_16,"Come on, follow me!"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_17,"Uhhh... I can't get up there...!"
DG_ZONE2_LV1_18,"Oh, right."
DG_ZONE2_LV1_19,"Well, just try to keep up! I'll see if I can link up with you further ahead!"
DG_ZONE2_LV9_1,"Oh, there you are."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_2,"I've gotta be honest..."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_3,"I actually have no idea where we're going."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_4,"Me neither."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_5,"This place is huge."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_6,"Here."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_7,"I think we should conserve our energy."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_8,"We don't know how long we'll be down here after all."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_9,"If we make it back to base at all."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_10,"Hmmm..."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_11,"It might be a good idea to split up."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_12,"After all, we can cover more ground that way."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_13,"And only one of us needs to reach base to warn the commander about..."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_14,"...whatever that thing was..."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_15,"What WAS that anyway?"
DG_ZONE2_LV9_16,"I don't know, but it wasn't like any virus I've ever seen."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_17,"These viruses seem to be getting more and more dangerous."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_18,"All the more reason to warn the commander about what's coming."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_19,"Right. We should get moving soon."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_20,"Things could get sticky if they reach base before us."
DG_ZONE2_LV9_21,"[speed mult=4]HEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLP!!!![/speed]"
DG_ZONE2_LV9_22,"What was that?"
DG_ZONE2_LV9_23,"Come on, let's see what it is."
DG_ZONE2_LV10_1,"Up there!"
DG_ZONE2_LV10_2,"..."
DG_ZONE2_LV10_3,"I ate my hat."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_1,"Wow. I thought you were a goner."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_2,"Thanks for the help you two. That thing came out of nowhere."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_3,"No problem. We have to look out for each other if we're gonna make it back to base in one piece."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_4,"Speaking of which..."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_5,"There's this elevator here that'll take us straight there."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_6,"Huh. That's convenient."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_7,"Wait. There may still be survivors down here."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_8,"You're right."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_9,"You don't need us to warn the commander."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_10,"We're better off looking for survivors down here."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_11,"If things get dicey I'll try and secure an escape route."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_12,"But hopefully it won't come to that."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_13,"Ok. I'll hurry."
DG_ZONE2_LV11_14,"Good luck."
DG_ZONE3_LV1_1,"Oh no..."
DG_ZONE3_LV1_2,"I'm too late."
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_1,"EEP!"
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_2,"A survivor??"
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_3,"Where'd you come from!?"
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_4,"Doesn't matter."
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_5,"This computer already belongs to us."
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_6,"You'll die like the rest of them."
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_7,"AUGGGGHH!!!"
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_8,"You imbecile!"
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_9,"Go on. scurry along. See if I care."
DG_ZONE3_BOSS_10,"I'll find you. And next time won't be so easy."
DG_ZONE3_LV10_1,"Commander...?"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_2,"[speed mult=1.5]COMMANDER!!![/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_3,"Commander, are you alright!?"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_4,"*cough, cough*"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_5,"What happened??"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_6,"..."
DG_ZONE3_LV10_7,"[speed mult = 0.7]There were... Too many...[/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_8,"[speed mult = 0.5] I had to...[/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_9,"[speed mult=0.4]Initiate the...[/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_10,"[speed mult=0.3]The...[/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_11,"[speed mult=0.15]Self destruct.[/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_12,"[speed mult=2.0]WHAT!?![/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_13,"Commander, you can't be serious!"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_14,"I had no choice..."
DG_ZONE3_LV10_15,"[speed mult = 0.7]I had to stop them...[/speed]"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_16,"[speed mult=0.8]You[/speed] [speed mult=0.7]have to[/speed] [speed mult=0.6]escape[/speed] [speed mult=0.5]through[/speed] [speed mult=0.4]the[/speed] [speed mult=0.3]ancient[/speed] [speed mult=0.2]city[/speed]..."
DG_ZONE3_LV10_17,"COMMANDER!!"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_18,"Wait..."
DG_ZONE3_LV10_19,"I've never seen this tunnel before..."
DG_ZONE3_LV10_20,"Is this what the commander was talking about...?"
DG_ZONE3_LV10_21,"That might be my best way out."
DG_ZONE3_LV10_22,"I've gotta get out of here fast!"
DG_ZONE4_LV1_1,"This should be where the tunnel is..."
DG_ZONE4_LV1_2,"I think."
DG_ZONE4_LV1_3,"It's so dark in here!"
DG_ZONE4_LV1_4,"There's gotta be some way to get some light in here..."
DG_ZONE4_LV1_5,"Wow..."
DG_ZONE4_LV2_1,"[speed mult=2.0]BZZZZZZZ--[/speed] VIRUS DETECTED"
DG_ZONE4_LV2_2,"Wait! I'm not a virus!"
DG_ZONE4_LV2_3,"INITIATING DEFENSE PROTOCOL"
DG_ZONE4_CHASE,"I've got you now!"
DG_ZONE4_LV8_1,"Its started... [speed mult=1.3]The computer's gonna explode!![/speed]"
DG_ZONE4_LV8_2,"I need to get out of here!"
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_1,"[speed mult=1.5]Look out![/speed]"
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_2,"Good to see you made it in one piece."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_3,"That virus nearly got me!!"
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_4,"Yeah, unfortunately this secret tunnel isn't so secret anymore."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_5,"But viruses will be the least of our worries in a moment."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_6,"That's our cue to leave."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_7,"Uhhhhhh that's a lot of viruses!"
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_8,"Looks like they've got us surrounded too..."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_9,"There's got to be at least 1,000 of these guys..."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_10,"And there's no other way out!?"
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_11,"Doesn't look like it."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_12,"I don't like where this is going..."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_13,"We have to fight them."
DG_ZONE4_LASTSTAND_14,"Come on, this is nothing we can't handle."
DG_ZONE4_L10_1,"...Is that all of them?"
DG_ZONE4_L10_2,"I think so..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_3,"Oh no..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_4,"There's got to be at least..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_5,"10,000 of these guys!"
DG_ZONE4_L10_6,"I don't think I can last much longer..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_7,"No! We can't give up now!"
DG_ZONE4_L10_8,"We have to fight them! There's no other way!"
DG_ZONE4_L10_9,"Uggggghhhhh..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_10,"Come on, get ready..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_11,"NOW!!"
DG_ZONE4_L10_12,"Wait. What was that?"
DG_ZONE4_L10_13,"We received a distress call coming from this computer."
DG_ZONE4_L10_14,"It looks like we got here just in the nick of time."
DG_ZONE4_L10_15,"You can say that again. We would've been toast if you hadn't shown up."
DG_ZONE4_L10_16,"Are you two the only survivors?"
DG_ZONE4_L10_17,"Unfortunately, yes. They completely wiped our defenses."
DG_ZONE4_L10_18,"Hmmmmm..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_19,"This sounds like the work of the [color=green]Virus King.[/color]"
DG_ZONE4_L10_20,"He's been gathering his forces for some time, but if he's finally making a move..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_21,"This could be bad. Very bad."
DG_ZONE4_L10_22,"We're part of the antivirus of a computer not far from here."
DG_ZONE4_L10_23,"You'd be much safer with us."
DG_ZONE4_L10_24,"That sounds like our best bet. How about it?"
DG_ZONE4_L10_25,"Anything to get out of here..."
DG_ZONE4_L10_26,"I think this has been just about the worst day of my life."
DG_ZONE4_L10_27,"Alright. Stay close to us and we can escort you there."
